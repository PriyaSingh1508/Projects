# SPAM EMAIL DETECTION PROJECT
One of the main uses of machine learning in the modern internet is spam detection. Almost all of the major email service providers have built-in spam detection systems that categorise such emails as "Junk Mail" when they occur.
In this project, we'll use the Naive Bayes method to build a model that can distinguish between spam and legitimate email. Since mails are either labelled as "Spam" or "Ham," identifying spam is a binary classification problem. Additionally, since we will be providing the model a labelled dataset that it can use to learn from and make future predictions, this is a supervised learning problem.

This project has been broken down in to the following steps:  
1)Data Preprocessing in order to remove noise from dataset.  
2)Tokenization  
3)Stop Words removal  
4)Stemming  
5)Feature extraction refers to process of transforming raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original data set.  
6)Training model   
7)Testing model
